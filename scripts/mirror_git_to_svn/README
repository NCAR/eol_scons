This directory contains scripts for creating and maintaining a
read-only subversion mirror of the eol_scons git repository.

Many software projects at EOL use svn:external subversion properties to
access the eol_scons SCons framework. With this mirror, these externals will
still work.

The subversion repository http://svn/svn/eol/common/trunk/site_scons
was cloned to become the public git repository at github:
http://github.com/ncareol/eol_scons, using the clone_svn_to_git.sh
script, listed below.

The git master branch on http://github.com/ncareol/eol_scons is then
mirrored to http://svn/svn/eol/common/trunk/site_scons by the jenkins server
at EOL. The eol_scons jenkins project polls github for changes, and then
runs the mirror_git_to_svn.sh script listed below.

Only the master branch of the git repository is mirrored to
subversion at EOL, and commits to the subversion side will be disallowed,
via a pre-commit hook.
    

Scripts:

    clone_svn_to_git.sh
        Script which was used to create a git clone of the trunk of the EOL
        site_scons subversion repository, along whth as much of the history
        from its branches and tags as git-svn could follow.
        As a final step a bare git eol_scons repository is cloned. 


    push_github.sh
        Next, a public eol_scons repository was created at github using an
        ncareol account, and this script was used to push the bare eol_scons
        repository to github.

    mirror_git_to_svn.sh
        Script run by jenkins to mirror git to subversion when a commit is 
        detected on the github repository.

        After jenkins has fetched the changes from github, execute this
        command in the shell:

        eol_scons/scripts/mirror_git_to_svn/git_svn_mirror.sh
